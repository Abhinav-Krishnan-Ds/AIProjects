) Import libraries
2) we use opencv to perform selective search
3) we need to download opencv-contrib-python: pip install opencv-contrib-python
    opencv-python distribution wont work
4) get_iou has to be defined


Getting the data
1) for each image in the dir, we need to get their bb values from another dir "labels"
        we may use " readlink -f folder_name " to get the path of directory
2) we need to perform selective search on each image from dir "images"
        - setBaseImage(image)
        - switchSelectiveSearchFast()
        - ss.process()
        - plot the image and its segments
3) iou threshold is 0.7 above which the classification is positive "1"
    append resized image of the corresponding image to train_images and label 1 to train_labels
4) iou threshold is 0.3 below which the classification is negative "0"
    append resized image of the corresponding image to train_images and label 0 to train_labels
5) from the 2000 regions proposed, we just take 30 positive and 30 negative classes to train the model
